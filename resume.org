:END:
As a Senior Engineer in Wireless Research and Development team at Qualcomm, Bangalore, my work is on modern communication technologies. Being a PhD from IISc, ECE department, I have strong background in signal processing, coding, and machine learning and I've also worked on image processing and computer vision projects.
** Experience
*** Qualcomm, Bangalore | Feb 2024 - Present | /Senior Engineer, WRD Team/
Focus on modern wireless technologies like 5G and digital twin. Building machine learning architecture to predict various properties of wireless networks. Using ML based predictions for better resource allocation or for network analysis.
*** IISc, Bangalore | Jan 2020 - Jul 2023 | /Teaching as PMRF TA/
As part of PMRF responsibilities, taught GATE EC related courses at various institutions. Taught 2nd and 3rd year students. Subjects: Networks, Signal and systems, communication systems and misc topics on electromagnetic field theory, analog and digital electronics. Focused on problem solving and previous year GATE problems.
